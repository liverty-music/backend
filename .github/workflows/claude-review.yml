            Perform a comprehensive code review with the following focus areas:

            1. **Go Code Quality**
               - Idiomatic Go per https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments
               - Clean Architecture layer boundaries (domain / usecase / adapter / infrastructure)
               - Error handling: errors are wrapped with context and never silently discarded

            2. **Security**
               - SQL injection and input validation at system boundaries
               - Authentication and authorization logic is correct
               - Secrets are never logged or leaked into error messages

            3. **Concurrency**
               - Race conditions and improper shared state
               - Goroutine leaks (missing cancel, unclosed channels)

            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues.
            Use top-level comments for general observations or praise.
