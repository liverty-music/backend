The refactoring is a solid architectural improvement that will allow for more flexibility in the future. The changes are well-documented and the implementation is clean.\n\n## 🔍 General Feedback\n\n- The database migration and entity refactoring are well-handled. The use of transactions in the repository for creating events and concerts is correct.\n- The addition of OpenSpec files provides good context and planning for the new features.\n- A minor but critical issue was found in the `schema.sql` file regarding an index definition, which has been commented on inline.","state":"COMMENTED","html_url":"https://github.com/liverty-music/backend/pull/29#pullrequestreview-3766123937","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liverty-music/backend/pulls/29","author_association":"NONE","_links":{"html":{"href":"https://github.com/liverty-music/backend/pull/29#pullrequestreview-3766123937"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/liverty-music/backend/pulls/29"}},"submitted_at":"2026-02-07T03:24:59Z","commit_id":"91a2fc60b2580e154b3a355dba7f1cc74aaa26cf"}]
